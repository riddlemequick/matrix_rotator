Matrix Rotator
==============

A creative and easy way in PERL to rotate a 2d matrix of any size and shape (90 degree clockwise)

# Features
- very clean and simplistic
- uses only 1 variable, `@ref_matrix` (aside from `$_`)
- non-convoluted algorithm, easy to follow
- accomodates any 2D array of any size or shape 

# Algorithm
- swap x axis to y axis
- loop in reverse through new x axis
